CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
1.	Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2.	Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3.	Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4.	Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5.	Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
tag(element) Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
Ex: 	h1{
		Color:green;
	}
id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
 	The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
 	To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
Ex:	#id{
			text-align:center;
		}




class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
 	To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
Ex:	.classname{
			font-style: italic;
		}

Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.	
Ex:	*{
			background-color:yellow;
		}
Attribute Selectors
 	Style HTML Elements With Specific Attributes
 	It is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute values.
[attribute] Selector
The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.
Ex:	a[target] {
  			background-color: yellow;
}





[attribute="value"] Selector
The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.
Ex:	a[target="_blank"] {
 		 background-color: yellow;
}

[attribute^="value"] Selector
The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value starts with the specified value.
Ex:	[class^="top"] {
 		 background: yellow;
}
[attribute$="value"] Selector
The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.
Ex:	[class$="test"] {
  		background: yellow;
}
 [attribute*="value"] Selector
The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.
Ex:	[class*="te"] {
  		background: yellow;
}
